# robotfw-web

This repository contains a basic test suite utilizing [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) with the [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) to automate tests in the user interface for login and signup functionality.

## Structure

-   `tests/`: Contains the test cases, separated by segment.
-   `resources/`: Resources shared between tests, like variables and reusable keywords.
-   `output/`: Contains the test execution logs, reports and allure specific files.
-   `allure-report`: Contains reports generated by allure.
-   `venv`: Python virtual environment, where dependencies are installed.
-   `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies.
-   `.gitignore`: Version control configuration.

    > **Note**: Some directories are created upon test execution.

## Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+** (Recommended: Python 3.11+)
-   Packages listed on requirements.txt.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/araujo2kg/robotfw-web.git
```

2. Navigate to the correct directory:

```
cd robotfw-web
```

3. Create a python virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```
# Linux/macOs
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

1. Execute tests:

```
robot --outputdir output tests/
```

2. View reports:

```
# Linux
xdg-open output/log.html output/report.html

# macOs
open output/log.html output/report.html

# Windows
start output/log.html output/report.html
```

## Generating Custom Reports with Allure

1. Install **Allure** [here](https://allurereport.org/docs/install/).

2. Install the Allure adapter for Robot Framework:

```
pip install allure-robotframework
```

3. Run tests with Allure integration:

```
robot --outputdir output --listener allure_robotframework tests/
```

4. Generate an Allure report:

```
allure generate output/allure --single-file --clean
```

5. Open the report:

```
allure open allure-report/
```
